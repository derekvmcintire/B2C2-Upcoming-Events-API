# Comprehensive API Testing Strategy
---

### **1. Types of Tests to Write**

#### **Unit Tests**
- Focus on individual serverless functions (`hello`, `getEventsByType`, `submitEvent`).
- Mock dependencies like Firestore and BikeReg API to isolate behavior.
- Ensure all edge cases are covered, especially for validation (e.g., invalid `type` values, malformed URLs).

#### **Integration Tests**
- Test interactions between the API and Firebase Firestore.
- Include a test environment for Firebase (using Firestore emulator).
- Verify end-to-end workflows, like fetching events by type or submitting new events.

#### **End-to-End (E2E) Tests**
- Simulate real HTTP requests to the API in a controlled environment (e.g., staging or locally).
- Validate the full flow, including Firestore data persistence and BikeReg API calls.

#### **Load Tests**
- Evaluate the performance of the API under different traffic levels.
- Prioritize endpoints like `GET /getEventsByType` since they may face higher traffic.
- Use tools like **Artillery**, **k6**, or **Locust** for realistic load scenarios.

#### **Security Tests**
- Test for improper handling of invalid or malicious data:
  - SQL/NoSQL injection attempts.
  - Invalid or malformed input (e.g., `type` as `DROP TABLE`).
- Validate secure handling of Firebase credentials.

#### **Smoke Tests**
- Quick sanity checks on key endpoints (`GET /hello`, `GET /getEventsByType`) to confirm API is functional after deployments.

### **2. Testing Environments**

#### **Local Environment**
- Use the Firestore emulator to run local tests without affecting production data.
- Test the API locally using `npm run dev` and tools like Postman or Thunder Client.
- Add tests to ensure compatibility with the local dev environment.

#### **Staging/Preview Environment**
- Use Vercel preview deployments for integration and E2E tests.
- Isolate this environment from production to avoid interference with real users or data.

#### **Production Environment**
- Avoid running destructive or resource-intensive tests here.
- Perform lightweight monitoring, such as periodic health checks (e.g., `GET /hello`).

### **3. Incorporating Tests into GitHub Workflow**

Add the following to your CI/CD pipeline:

1. **Unit Tests**: Run with `npm test` on every push and pull request.
2. **Integration Tests**: Use the Firestore emulator during CI to validate database interactions.
3. **Static Analysis**:
   - TypeScript type-checking.
   - ESLint for linting issues.
4. **Deployment Tests**:
   - Automatically run smoke tests against Vercel preview URLs after successful deployment.

Example `ci.yml` additions:
```yaml
jobs:
  tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 18
      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm install
      - name: Run Linting
        run: npm run lint
      - name: Type-Check
        run: npm run type-check
      - name: Run Unit Tests
        run: npm test
  integration-tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Setup Firebase Emulator
        uses: w9jds/firebase-action@v1.6.0
        with:
          args: emulators:start
      - name: Run Integration Tests
        run: npm run test:integration
```

### **4. Focus on Critical Use Cases**

#### **High-Priority Areas**
- **Validation**: Ensure `type` and `url` parameters are correctly validated.
- **Error Handling**: Test all possible error scenarios (e.g., missing parameters, invalid input).
- **Third-Party API Calls**: Mock and test interaction with BikeReg GraphQL API for robustness.
- **Concurrency**: Verify `submitEvent` handles duplicate events efficiently.

#### **Lower Priority (For Now)**
- Rare edge cases or non-critical features like `GET /hello`.

---

### **5. Tools and Libraries**

#### **Testing Frameworks**
- **Jest**: For unit and integration tests.
- **Supertest**: To test HTTP endpoints.
- **Fireorm/Firebase Emulator**: For Firestore integration testing.

#### **Load Testing**
- **Artillery**: Easy to configure for serverless APIs.
- **k6**: Scriptable and scalable.

#### **E2E Testing**
- **Postman/Newman**: For automated API tests.
- **Cypress**: If front-end integration is needed.

---

### **Next Steps**
1. Start with **unit tests** for `hello`, `getEventsByType`, and `submitEvent`.
2. Set up the Firestore emulator for **integration tests**.
3. Create smoke test scripts for CI and deploy pipelines.
4. Implement a basic **load test** for `GET /getEventsByType`.
